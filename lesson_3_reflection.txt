When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work

   When I want to share my work to others, or sharing things between different computer

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with youur remote respository?

   I might still working on my local version copy and not really to merge the new code. Pull manually I can have the full control when my current version is stable and ready

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

   forks is GitHub feature, it is nothing about git!! You can use this to clone someone repository in your GitHub repositories directly.

   clones is Git stuff and it is used to make a copy of complete history of another repository.

   branches is another version copy of of the repository, you can have different branches to maintenance different changes or version of your stuff.

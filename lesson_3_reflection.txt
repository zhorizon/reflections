When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work

   When I want to share my work to others, or sharing things between different computer

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with youur remote respository?

   I might still working on my local version copy and not really to merge the new code. Pull manually I can have the full control when my current version is stable and ready
